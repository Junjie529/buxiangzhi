# Installation

You can install the package via Composer
```shell
composer require hammerstone/sidecar
```

Once the package is installed, you may publish the config file by running 
```shell
php artisan sidecar:install
```

You'll need to configure your AWS keys for your `sidecar.php`, we've gone to great lengths to make this easy by providing a command to walk you through it interactively.

Read the [Configuration](configuration) section to learn more.
